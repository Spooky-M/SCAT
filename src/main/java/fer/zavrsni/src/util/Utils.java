            "Application in home/userx/Documents folder, PPProjekt folder should be placed like this: " +
            "\"home/userx/Documents/Application/PPProjekt\". Script can also be run from command line, " +
            "and its documentation is also available on Github. In short, this plugin provides an interface " +
            "for easier selection of desired tools and runs the Python script. The Python script runs " +
